`Polymake.jl` is a Julia package for using [`polymake`](https://polymake.org/doku.php), a software for research in polyhedral geometry from Julia.
This package is developed as part of the [OSCAR](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de) project.

The current version of `Polymake.jl` relies on `polymake` version `4.0` or later.

## Supported Platforms

While this package does support most julia platforms apart from Windows, everything except `x86_64-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` is considered experimental.
